# Financial Portfolio Optimization and Prediction Using Machine Learning
# Overview
This notebook demonstrates the application of machine learning techniques for financial portfolio optimization and prediction. The primary focus is on utilizing Random Forest and LSTM models to predict stock returns and build optimized portfolios using Monte Carlo simulations.

# Key Features
Data Analysis and Preprocessing

# Identification and handling of missing data.
Calculation of technical indicators for enhanced prediction accuracy.
Time-series data preprocessing using normalization and feature engineering.

# Portfolio Optimization

Use of Monte Carlo simulations for risk-adjusted portfolio optimization.
Constraints applied:
Maximum daily volume of 100 shares.
Operational cost of $1 per day.
Initial capital limit of $10,000.
Calculation of daily portfolio returns, risk, and cumulative performance metrics.

# Model Training and Evaluation

Random Forest: Predictive model for financial returns using historical data.
LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory): Deep learning model for sequential financial data.
Evaluation metrics: RMSE, MAE, cumulative returns, and portfolio value trends.

# Comparison of Models

Performance comparison between Random Forest, LSTM, and real portfolio returns.
Insights into each model's efficiency in predicting market trends and optimizing returns.

# Visualization

Graphical representation of daily portfolio returns, cumulative returns, and portfolio value trends over time.
Notable Code Functions
Portfolio Optimization

portfolio_daily_return: Calculates daily returns for a portfolio.
portfolio_risk: Computes portfolio risk using the covariance matrix.
objective_function: Balances risk and return using a customizable lambda parameter.
monte_carlo_daily_optimization: Performs Monte Carlo simulations to optimize portfolio allocation.

# Data Preprocessing

# Results and Insights
Random Forest: Achieved near-real market performance with cumulative returns close to 15%.
LSTM: Demonstrated reasonable performance but lagged behind Random Forest due to potential overfitting or insufficient temporal patterns in training data.
Optimized Portfolio: Monte Carlo simulation highlighted robust performance with cumulative returns exceeding 16%, demonstrating a stable growth trajectory.
